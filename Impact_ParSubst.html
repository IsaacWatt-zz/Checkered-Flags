                    <p>Children’s education and performance in school may suffer because of parental problems with
                        alcohol or other drug use. Parents who misuse/abuse substances may struggle to be involved in
                        their children’s education, which can impact homework completion and attendance. As well, some
                        children may feel responsible for their parent’s drug or alcohol use. They may feel that they
                        are to blame for the substance misuse or that they should be able to stop their parents from
                        abusing substances.</p>
