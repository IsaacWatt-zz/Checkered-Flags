                    <p>Tying recreation to school culture elicits buy-in from students who may be ambivalent or
                        discouraged about their connection to the school community. While it is certainly true that
                        schools cannot undertake, in addition to all their myriad responsibilities for students, to
                        build and run recreation programs for them as well, it is worth linking vulnerable students with
                        recreation and mentorship opportunities. Research consistently shows a positive correlation
                        between positive recreation experiences, a student’s improved school performance, and increased
                        RESILIENCE. (The National Arts and Youth Demonstration Project is one of many projects that have
