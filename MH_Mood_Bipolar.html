                    <p>A child with bipolar problems suffers swings in mood ranging from depressed to overly energized
                        or manic. These problems usually do not develop until late adolescence or adulthood, but there
                        are some younger children who experience mood swings and rages that are considered to stem from
                        the same source. Children struggling with this difficulty often experience very fast mood swings
                        between depression and mania many times in a day. Children with mania are more likely to be
                        irritable and prone to destructive tantrums than to be overly happy and elated. Mixed symptoms
                        also are common in young adolescents dealing with bipolar problems; older adolescents may have
                        more classic, adult-type episodes and symptoms. Bipolar difficulties in children and teens can
                        be difficult to distinguish from other problems and may sometimes go unnoticed at school,
                        especially for children who can “hold it together” at school but then “explode” when they get
                        home.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Because bipolar problems affect the part of the brain that supports memory, concentration,
                            and emotional regulation, students may have difficulty concentrating on, understanding, and
                            remembering assignments or staying focused on long or complex work.
                        </li>
                        <li>Students dealing with bipolar problems often feel overwhelmed by the intensity of their
                            emotions.
                        </li>
                        <li>The social aspects of school may be just as difficult as the academic work for these
                            students.

                    <p>Even the tried and true strategies of experienced teams may not work consistently, given a
                        student’s frequent mood shifts, and school teams can feel frustrated and find it hard to deliver
                        the extra reassurance that a student grappling with mood problems may need. This in turn can
                        leave the student feeling unequal to the demands of school life.</p>
