                    <p>One out of every six children in our schools lives with poverty and its impact. (Report Card on
                        Child Poverty in Ontario, p.1) That means that their parents or caregivers struggle every day to
                        find enough money to meet the basic costs of living: food, housing, and heating. Research shows
                        that children in low-income families have poorer physical health and suffer the effects of
                        poorer nutrition than children in higher-income families. Poor parental health can put these
                        children at a disadvantage even before they are born (e.g., resulting in early difficulties such
                        as low birth weight). When students are dealing with poverty, they can end up excluded from
                        important parts of school life, and they can feel that they do not fit in with other members of
                        the school community. They may face more physical and mental stress and are more likely to be
                        hospitalized and suffer from dental problems. If they come from families who are working poor or
                        otherwise in precarious employment, these difficulties are compounded by lack of benefits.</p>

                            alert and ready to learn through the school day.

                        <li>A student’s need for special education is directly linked to family income. The likelihood
                            of children from low-income families requiring special education is about twice that of
                            children from middle- and high-income families.
                        </li>
                        <li>Students may miss out on many important aspects of school life simply because their families
                            cannot afford the costs of participation, and they or their parents find it too embarrassing
                            or awkward to seek subsidy or support. Students may drop courses or other activities rather
                            than admit that they can’t afford the supplies, fees, clothing, or equipment needed for
                            participation. They may report illness or appointments to avoid special events that their
                            families cannot afford, such as field trips.
                        </li>
                        <li>Students who feel different from their peers will often feel that they do not belong at
                            school. This may put them at greater risk of dropping out of school.
                        </li>
                        <li>Lack of income makes it difficult to afford over-the-counter medication or supplementary
                            medical or dental care, increasing the likelihood that these children will have to do
                            without helpful treatments.

                                <li>Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. Education can make all the
                                    difference to a student’s future income potential and ability to move beyond the
                                    poverty of his/her childhood.

                                <li>Children who live in poverty are often embarrassed by their circumstances and work
                                    hard to protect their parents. Make sure that any conversations with children about
                                    their circumstances or offers of support for them are conducted in private.
                                </li>
                                <li>Hunger, insecure and unsafe housing, and poor physical health contribute to an
                                    increased risk of difficulties in school.
                                </li>
                                <li>Poor children are just as intelligent as other children, but poverty can lead to
                                    higher stress levels, poor concentration, and lower functioning vision, hearing,
                                    speech, mobility, dexterity, and cognition. Work to recognize the signs of poverty.

                                <li>Adopt a matter-of-fact approach to questions about whether expense is a barrier to
                                    participation. When you model that it is normal for schools to offer financial
                                    support as needed to ensure that all students can participate, parents will feel
                                    less self-conscious about accepting assistance.
                                </li>
                                <li>Consider ways to cost share among parents to reduce the burden on those with lower
                                    incomes—e.g., propose a sliding scale for a school activity, trusting that parents
                                    who can pay at the higher end of the scale will do so.
                                </li>
                                <li>Plan for inclusive treats and snacks—e.g., consider how to extend the school
                                    breakfast programs, which most schools support, to cover periodic hot lunch days as
                                    well to help prevent students from feeling socially isolated.
                                </li>
                                <li>Given that 32% of children living in poverty go without food on a regular basis,
                                    remember to investigate the possibility of hunger when concentration or behaviour
                                    seems to lag.
                                </li>

                                <li>Consider ways to promote low-cost/no-cost access to school resources—e.g., a skates
                                    or musical instrument library can help give students access to the equipment they
                                    need to take part in school or recreational activities.

                                <li>Make sure that community or school subsidy options are well known to parents and
                                    caregivers—e.g., have information available in school foyers or circulated in
                                    newsletters.

                                <li>Consider school anti-stigma campaigns so that poverty is not seen as an embarrassing
                                    secret but a simple matter of circumstance.
                                </li>
                                <li>Champion meal programs, sliding scales, or fee waiving to ensure that all students
                                    can participate in school activities.
                                </li>
                                <li>Search out innovative partnerships that benefit students living in poverty—e.g., ask
                                    the piano teacher to give free lessons, encourage judo in the gym after school with
                                    sponsorship for some families.
