                    <p>Pressures such as poverty, homelessness, separation and divorce, or other sudden losses or
                        disruptions in their lives affect more than half of school-age children, and the impact of these
                        situations on their success and well-being is profound. Although the circumstances cannot always
                        be changed, by working together we can mitigate their impact and help children stay on track.
                        Because these areas are viewed as private, it can be difficult to address these concerns with
                        children. This chapter offers schools, parents and caregivers, and community partners practical
                        approaches for responding to some of these issues.</p>

                    <h4>What Can Schools Do?</h4>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>A positive environment that encourages success is the most important thing schools can offer
                        their students. The positive impact of school is strengthened when the caring support available
                        through schools is emphasized—whether it is inclusion in hot lunch programs, recreation
                        opportunities, the consistent attention of a member of the school staff, or the reassuring
                        structure of school life. When students need a little more support because of external
                        pressures, their load can be lightened by providing them with knowledge of and a gateway to
                        resources that can help. When the school environment offers universal programs, everyone is
                        helped or supported, including those students who need it the most.</p>
