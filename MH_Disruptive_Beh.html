                    <p>When children with disruptive behaviour seem angry, it may be the result of unresolved
                        circumstances. They are quick to blame others for mistakes. They generally have poor peer
                        relationships and often display behaviours that alienate them from their peers. In addition,
                        these children may have an unusual response to positive reinforcement or feedback: when given
                        public praise, for example, they may respond by destroying or sabotaging the project for which
                        they were given recognition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some children develop disruptive behaviours as a result of the stress and frustration resulting
                        from experiences such as divorce, death, loss of family, or family disharmony. Disruptive
                        behaviour may also be a way of dealing with depression or the result of inconsistent rules and
                        expectations for behaviour.</p>

                                <li>Choose your battles wisely. Remember that students with disruptive behaviour tend to
                                    create
                                    power struggles. Try to avoid being drawn in.

                                <li>Use a quiet, private, and calm approach. Allow students to state their position
                                    first, and
                                    let them know that their point of view is being heard and understood.

                                <li>Give choices when decisions are needed. State them briefly and clearly.</li>
                                <li>Ensure that academic work is at the appropriate level. When work is too hard,
                                    students will
                                    become frustrated; when it is too easy, they will become bored. Both reactions lead
                                    to
                                    problems in the classroom.

                                <li>Clear classroom rules are very important for students with disruptive behaviours. Be
                                    clear
                                    about what is non-negotiable.

                                <li>Post the daily schedule so that students are clear about expectations.</li>
                                <li>Praise students (in subtle ways) when they respond positively.</li>
                                <li>Avoid making comments or bringing up situations that may be a source of argument
                                    .Provide
                                    consistency, structure, and clear consequences for the students’ behaviour.
