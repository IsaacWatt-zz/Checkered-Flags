                        “doomed”, and mental health difficulties need not be more than a temporary impediment, even in
                        the face of ongoing challenges. Learning to respond well to challenges can actually strengthen

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>When licensed professionals, such as doctors or psychologists, make a diagnosis of a mental
                        health problem, they refer to a reference guide, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                        Disorders, Fourth Edition (known as DSM-IV), to help them determine if the difficulty meets the
                        criteria to be called a disorder. Sometimes a diagnosis helps educators, families, and
                        counsellors plan how to help a child succeed. As much as possible, the term “disorder” has been
                        avoided in the Fact Sheets to emphasize that their purpose is not in any way to replace the

                    <h4><i class="fa fa-fw fa-binoculars"></i>General Principles </h4>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>When trying to assess whether a child is struggling with an underlying mental health concern,
                        consider the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>What does the difficulty look like? The difficulties experienced by many children with mental
                        health problems can sometimes be seen as being disruptive and/or unruly—similar to children who
                        just need more structure or direction. Or the difficulties may drive children inward, and they
                        can just seem introverted and quiet when perhaps they are anxious or sad. Because teachers spend
                        so much time with their students in a setting where the students are required to be engaged,
                        they are often the first to notice a mental health difficulty. When close attention is given to
                        the student’s behaviour, mood, and how they communicate with others, it may be possible to tease
                        out with a little more clarity whether they are struggling with issues affecting their mental
                        health and develop focused approaches to supporting them—emotionally, behaviourally, and
                        academically.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><em>Jane was well liked by her teachers, who saw her as a talented writer and easy to have in
                        class. When she started to develop a sore stomach every afternoon before recess and acted
                        belligerently when the teacher insisted she have some time outdoors, everyone was surprised. The
                        vice-principal wondered if Jane might be anxious about something, and called home. Mom was able
                        to share that Jane’s dad had moved out of the family home, and Jane seemed to be needing more
                        “alone time”. She had always found it hard to be with larger groups of students and anxiety was
                        getting the better of her. Once these details were uncovered, everyone was better able to set a
                        less stressful pace and a plan to help Jane manage her social anxiety.</em></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>What is the impact?</strong> In order to develop a range of strategies to support
                        children, it is important to consider how much distress the child’s problems are causing them
                        and those around them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Risk:</strong> What factors have initiated and maintained the problem? It is important in
                        thinking about the causes of a child’s difficulties, and any possible solutions, to consider all
                        those aspects of the child’s life that may have contributed to the difficulties, whether within
                        the child him/herself or in the school, home, or wider community.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> What assets are there to work with? Family, community ties, strong
                        academic skills, athleticism, sociability—these can be used as foundations to support a child
                        through a mental health challenge. Strengths are often equated with “pleasing” or
                        “accommodating” behaviour, and it is very easy to fail to catalogue and use some of the “less
                        pleasing” strengths to good effect. It is easy to say “strong-willed and stubborn are synonyms
                        for determined and persistent”—it can be harder to truly admire those qualities as assets and
                        figure out how to use them to help a child get on track. Sometimes, too, negative assumptions or
                        worries about children, especially about their mental health, can divert attention from their
                        budding strengths and deprive them of the nurture and positive encouragement they need to
                        thrive.</p>

                    <p><em>A famous Canadian comic recounted how in school, his comedic talents had gone relatively
                        unappreciated because his ADHD was so frustrating to contend with. But one observant teacher
                        promised that for each day that he was able to meet certain core expectations, he would be able
                        to have five minutes of audience time at the end of the day. That motivated him to build the
                        skills he needed to manage his symptoms more effectively… and helped launch a successful
                        career.</em></p>

                    <p>Mental health issues can go unnoticed in classrooms or can be disguised as something else.
                        Externalizing behaviours that prevent students from learning or participating appropriately in
                        school life may be easy to spot, but it can be hard to know what is behind the behaviour or what
                        can alleviate it. Other students— the “quiet ones”— may struggle with mental health issues in
                        ways that do not disrupt classroom life, but there is still a sense that “something” is
                        interfering with their ability to learn and benefit from school life. Either way, in the midst
                        of the myriad activities crammed into a school day, it can sometimes be hard to pin down the
                        basis for the concern felt when a student is faltering in some way, and it can be hard to
                        explain these concerns to parents/caregivers. At the same time, it can be hard to know what help
                        can be expected from community partners, and how to access that help. The Fact Sheets are meant
                        to describe some of the common mental health difficulties that children may contend with, how
                        they might appear in a classroom, how to respond effectively, and how to get extra help when
                        needed.</p>
