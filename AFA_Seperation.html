                    <p>Up to 50% of children have to deal with the impact of their parents’ decision to end a
                        marital/common-law relationship. The adjustments resulting from a marital breakdown are huge for
                        students. School changes, new routines, and changes in lifestyle and family income are hard for
                        children. Emotional distress—grief, anger, fear— caused by ongoing conflict between parents and
                        the acrimony that can accompany custody disputes can make the adjustment even harder.</p>
                    <p>When this burden of conflict and sorrow bears down on a student, school life is also likely to be
                        affected—marks may decline, and students may be less able to manage their emotions and stresses.
                        When difficulties persist, they can lead to mental health problems and affect academic success
                        and social development.</p>
                    <p>Most of these pressures are beyond the school’s ability to control, but there are some measures
                        that can help students stay on track.</p>

                    <p>Parental separation and divorce put students at risk. Mental health vulnerabilities can be
                        triggered or worsen, and a student’s belief in his/her own capacities can decline.</p>
                    <p>Studies indicate that children of divorced parents drop out of high school at a much higher rate.
                        A 20 year study of 9400 children showed that only 60% of children of divorced parents complete
                        high school, compared to 78.4% for children with parents who are still together. For students
                        who have been subject to the impact of more than one divorce, the drop-out rate rises to
                        50%.(Strohschein, Roos, and Brownell, 2009)</p>
