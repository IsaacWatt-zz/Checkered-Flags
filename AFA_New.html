                    <p>With more and more international and newcomer students participating in our school systems, it is
                        increasingly important to address the needs of newcomer families with support and guidance. Many
                        of our local communities are developing international recruitment plans to help contribute to
                        the growth and prosperity of the local economy. The newcomers we welcome into our communities
                        are a vital component of our future economic development—they bring diversity, skills, and
                        investment. It is important to understand that there is no typical newcomer family. Each family
                        member will experience the change in culture, country, and surroundings in a different way. In
                        order to fully support the child(ren), it is vital to address the needs of the parents to reduce
                        stress in the home overall. If you support the family, you support the child.</p>
