                    <p>A learning disability (LD) affects one or more of the ways that a person processes, remembers,
                        understands, and/or expresses information, therefore LDs impact not only education but many
                        areas of life. At the same time, it is important to remember that, by definition, a person with
                        a learning disability demonstrates average abilities in many areas related to thinking and
                        reasoning. LDs should not be confused with other disabilities, such as developmental
                        delay/disability, autism, vision or hearing impairments, or behavioural disorders. Attention
                        deficit/hyperactivity disorders and LDs often occur together, but the two disorders are not the
                        same. LDs often run in families.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>LDs are identified through psychological or psycho-educational assessment. These assessments use
                        standardized testing tools to identify impairments in one or more processes that directly relate
                        to learning and other areas of functioning. Assessments are conducted by qualified
                        professionals, and a diagnosis of a Learning Disability is given by regulated health
                        professionals, usually psychologists or psychological associates, who follow guidelines and
                        criteria for making the diagnosis.</p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>A learning disability can affect people in many different ways and can range from mild to severe.
                        Children may have difficulty expressing themselves, listening, and understanding; they may have
                        trouble reading and understanding what is read. Writing may be difficult for them (from spelling
                        through to written expression), or mathematics skills might be very weak (from computation to
                        applying a variety of skills to solve mathematical problems). LDs may also affect a child’s
                        ability to interact socially or stay organized. Difficulty with basic reading and language
                        skills are the most common areas affected by a learning disability, but some people with
                        learning disabilities may not struggle with reading and language but will struggle in other
                        ways.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the early years of schooling the following “signs” might be seen in students or in their
                        school work. These signs might lead us to look more closely at how and why the student is
                        struggling.</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>struggles more than is typical for his/her age to learn the connection between letters and
                            sounds
                        </li>
                        <li>transposes number sequences and/or confuses arithmetic signs</li>
                        <li>makes consistent reading and spelling errors, including substitutions</li>
                        <li>has difficulty learning and remembering facts</li>
                        <li>impulsive</li>
                        <li>has difficulty planning and predicting</li>
                        <li>slow to develop age-appropriate printing skills</li>
                        <li>has trouble telling time</li>
                        <li>poor coordination, unaware of physical surroundings</li>
                        <li>difficulty following routines (appears confused, forgets what to do, etc.)</li>
                        <li>loses belongings, messy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some students may progress adequately or with only a few struggles in the early years, but in
                        Grades 4 through 8 or beyond progress stalls or difficulties such as the following may emerge
                        and/or become more significant:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>slow to learn prefixes, root words, and other spelling strategies</li>
                        <li>weak spelling skills, frequently spells the same word differently in a single piece of
                            writing
                        </li>
                        <li>struggles to read aloud; makes many reading errors</li>
                        <li>has difficulty with word problems in mathematics</li>
                        <li>has difficulty with handwriting and may avoid writing</li>
                        <li>has trouble summarizing or making inferences when reading</li>
                        <li>performs poorly on tests</li>
                        <li>pays too little or too much attention to detail</li>
                        <li>weak memory skills</li>
                        <li>disorganized, books in a mess, loses things</li>
                        <li>social difficulties</li>
                        <li>anxious, withdrawn, low self-esteem</li>
                        <li>poor work habits and/or challenging behaviour—work avoidant, does not complete work; easily
                            frustrated; angry; disengaged from school
                        </li>

                    <br>
                    <p>Though these “signs” are commonly seen in students who have a learning disability, the list is
                        not exhaustive, and it should be noted that they may also be associated with difficulties other
                        than learning disabilities.</p>

                        enabling them to achieve successes in life. Many people who work in the area of learning
