                    <p>There is no right or wrong way to react to a loss. No two individuals will react in exactly the
                        same way. Grief reactions among children and youth are influenced by their developmental level,
                        personal characteristics, mental health, family and cultural influences, and previous exposure
                        to crisis, death, and loss. However, there are some general trends that can help adults
                        understand typical and atypical reactions of bereaved children. Sadness, confusion, and anxiety
                        are among the most common grief responses and are likely to occur for children of all ages.
                        Parents, teachers, and other caregivers should also understand how their own grief reactions and
                        responses to a loss may impact the experience of a child.</p>

                        </li>

                            community at large, and other personal factors. For example, those who have lost someone
                            close to them will need particular attention. It is important for adults to understand the
                            reactions they may observe and to be able to offer support.

                                <li>Listen. Talk about the loss; this gives children permission to talk about it, too.
                                    Be prepared to discuss the loss repeatedly.

                                <li>Ask questions to learn how children understand the loss, and gauge physical and
                                    emotional reactions.

                                    occurs over months and years.
