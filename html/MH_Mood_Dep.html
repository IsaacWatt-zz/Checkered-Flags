                        Most children feel sad at times in their lives. Feelings of discouragement, frustration, and
                        even a sense of despair are normal reactions to loss or disappointment and may last for days
                        before gradually disappearing. For many, the depressed moods are brief and disappear on their
                        own.
                        But when a case of the “blues” does not pass after a couple of weeks and begins to interfere
                        with family, school, and other aspects of life, the low mood may be a sign of clinical
                        depression. Being prone to more serious kinds of mood problems appears to have a genetic link
                        and can be seen to run in families. But it can also develop in response to life
                        circumstances—for example, if children are under stress early in life, their brains sometimes
                        change in ways that can leave them more vulnerable to stress and depression for the rest of
                        their lives.
                        Depression is sometimes triggered by a sad or painful event such as a death in the family. It
                        can develop in children who observe constant fighting between their parents or who experience
                        neglect or abuse. The longer depression persists, the higher the risk it will reappear at later
                        points in a child’s life.
