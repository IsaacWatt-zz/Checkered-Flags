                <p><strong>A.B.L.E. (Alternative Behaviour Learning Environment):</strong> A program which assists
                    students who have been involved in frequent or long term difficulties at school due to their
                    behaviour. The A.B.L.E. program will help to refocus students’ attitudes and energy into a more
                    positive and successful experience at school and in the community. Referrals come to the Regional
                    Superintendents of Education who then contact the A.B.L.E. program coordinator.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> include special teaching and assessment strategies, human supports,
                    and/or individualized equipment that help the student learn and demonstrate learning. ACCOMMODATIONS
                    described in a student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP) should include only those strategies and
                    supports that differ from what is normally provided during classroom instruction. More information
                    is available at www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/parents/speced.html</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Alternative Expectations:</strong> In some cases, a student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP)
                    will include expectations derived from an alternative program (such as social skills, communication,
                    and behaviour management). Alternative programs are intended to supplement, not replace, the
                    student’s access to the provincial curriculum. More information is available at
                    www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/parents/speced.html</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Alternative Therapy:</strong> A treatment that does not use drugs or bring unconscious mental
                    material into full consciousness. For example, yoga, GUIDED IMAGERY, expressive therapy, and massage
                    therapy are considered alternative therapies.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>ANA:</strong> Slang term for anorexia or anorexic.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Applied behaviour analysis (ABA):</strong> definition taken from Policy/Program Memorandum
                    No. 140, Ontario Ministry of Education.  ABA uses methods based on scientific principles of learning
                    and behaviour to build useful repertoires of behaviour and reduce problematic ones. In this
                    approach, the behaviour(s) to be changed are clearly defined and recorded. The antecedents of the
                    undesirable behaviour(s) are analysed, as are the reinforcers that might be maintaining the
                    undesirable behaviour(s) or that might be used to help develop adaptive behaviours. ABA methods can
                    support students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a number of ways. For example, ABA methods
                    can help a student to: develop positive behaviours (e.g., improve the ability to stay on task,
                    improve social interaction); learn new skills (e.g., comprehensive skills, including language
                    skills, social skills, motor skills, academic skills); transfer a positive behaviour or response
                    from one situation to another (e.g., from completing assignments in a special education class to
                    maintaining the same performance in a regular class).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Art Therapy:</strong> A form of expressive therapy that uses visual art to encourage the
                    client’s growth of self- awareness and self-esteem to make attitudinal and behavioural changes.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Atypical Antipsychotics:</strong> A new group of medications used to treat psychiatric
                    conditions. These drugs may have fewer side effects than older classes of drugs used to treat the
                    same psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Character Always Virtues:</strong> There are universal attributes that schools and

                    use them as a standard against which we hold ourselves accountable. They permeate all aspects of
                    school life, bind us together and form the basis of responsible citizenship. They are a foundation
                    for excellence and equity in education and for school communities that are respectful, safe, caring
                    and inclusive. (More information on character education can be found in the Finding Common Ground:

                    following eight areas: External Assets: Support, Empowerment, Boundaries and Expectations, and

                    strategies, materials, and pace should vary accordingly. This can be done by: using a variety of
                    groupings to meet student needs; providing alternative instruction/assessment activities; and
                    challenging students at an appropriate level, in light of their readiness, interests, and learning

                <p><strong>Section 23:</strong> The needs of most school-aged children/youth can be effectively met
                    within their family environments and through regular attendance in local schools. For students who
                    have social, emotional, and behavioural needs that prevent them from learning while attending their
                    community school, a care and treatment educational program provides an educational program that
                    involves teachers and the direct and indirect services of several trained professionals such as
                    child and youth workers, educational assistants, social workers, nurses, psychologists, medical
                    doctors, and psychiatrists. The children/youth learn and apply coping tools and strategies to
                    address their social, emotional and behavioural concerns. The provision of education in these
                    facilities is subject to an agreement between a district school board and a facility. SECTION 23
                    classrooms provide a small structured program that can accommodate a minimum of six (6) and a
                    maximum of twelve (12) students with an occupancy rate averaging nine (9) students.</p>
