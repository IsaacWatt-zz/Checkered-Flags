                    <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name given to a range of neurobiological disorders. They
                        may be referred to as “pervasive developmental disorders” (PDDs) or “autism spectrum disorders”
                        (ASDs). Types of autism spectrum disorders, or PDDs, include</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>autistic disorder</li>
                        <li>Asperger’s syndrome</li>
                        <li>childhood disintegrative disorder</li>
                        <li>Rett syndrome</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>While varying widely in severity of impairment, all of these disorders present with deficits in
                        communication and social skills and a pattern of restrictive or repetitive behaviour. Children
                        with ASD will present with unique strengths and needs, and most require individualized program
                        plans to meet their learning needs.</p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>The range of the Autism Spectrum is quite broad. There can be a wide variation in the strengths
                        and needs of children with ASD, but they generally struggle with communication, socialization,
                        and behaviour. The following are examples of these difficulties:</p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Communication</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In an early learner, communication may be non-existent or limited, echolalic, or dependent
                            on an augmentative system. A focus on functional communication should be a priority.
                        </li>
                        <li>An intermediate learner may show a deficit in specific language concepts and difficulty
                            generalizing new learning into practice.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <strong>Socialization</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The child may seem aloof and avoidant of contact or show a preference for things rather than
                            people and therefore be non-responsive to social reinforcement.
                        </li>
                        <li>The child may show a desire for inclusion but lack the skills to achieve it. Children with
                            ASD can seem like outsiders; even when they wish for inclusion, they often end up alone.
                        </li>
                        <li>Transitions may be difficult, and the child may be quite rigid.</li>
                        <li>Distress and strong reactions to direction are common, particularly where there is a severe
                            communication deficit.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <strong>Behaviour</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Behaviour may be repetitive and patterned.</li>
                        <li>Children with ASD are often either oversensitive or not sensitive enough to touch, taste,
                            and sound, which can lead to inappropriate behaviour.
                        </li>
                        <li>Children with ASD can have behavioural outbursts, especially when they need to manage change
                            and unpredictability.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sometimes the typical school environment—with its noises, lights, and material displays—can
                            leave students with ASD overstimulated and distressed.
                        </li>

                    <p>Due to the uniqueness of presentation each student needs an individualized program that is based

                        principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis has been identified as mandatory for students with
                        autism. When these ACCOMMODATIONS are not developed, students with autism struggle on the
                        periphery of school life. WHERE TO GO FOR HELP: See Special Education in the Where to Go for
