                        <li>is quiet, inattentive, forgetful, and easily distracted</li>

                            clarifying expectations do not help attention deficit problems may be at risk of affecting

                    <p>ADHD is the leading cause of referrals to mental health professionals and the youth justice
                        system; it seems to affect more boys than girls. The impact of ADHD is often experienced most
                        intensely when children try to meet the normal demands of school life—children may not have the
                        same difficulties at home, where the environment is different. Some students may be able to stay
                        on task when doing a project they find enjoyable, such as an art project, but have a harder time
                        when they have to work on something that is more difficult for them. AD/HD—where children
                        struggle with attention problems but without hyperactivity—tends to be less noticeable to
                        parents/caregivers and teachers, even though it may affect the children’s ability to perform at
                        their best.</p>
