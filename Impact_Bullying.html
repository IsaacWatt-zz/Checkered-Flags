                    <p>BULLYING is typically a form of repeated, persistent and aggressive behaviour directed at an individual or individuals that is intended to cause (or should be known to cause) fear and distress and/or harm to another person’s body, feelings, self-esteem, or reputation. BULLYING occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance. (Based on the Ontario Ministry of Education definition; for the full definition, refer to www.edu.gov.on.ca)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>BULLYING, discrimination, and sexual harassment are all intentionally harmful behaviours, physically and/or psychologically. They tend to be repetitive and persistent behaviours. BULLYING, discrimination, and sexual harassment leave victims feeling afraid, helpless, vulnerable, traumatized, rejected, isolated, and less than others. Victims feel powerless to resist, and perpetrators derive what they perceive as status and gratification.</p>

                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The classroom setting is likely where the less overt signs of BULLYING, sexual harassment, or discrimination will be evident.</li>
                            <li>Some students may be excluded in certain groupings in the class or in informal settings such as the schoolyard; they may be chosen last for teams and may prefer to spend their time with staff.</li>
                            <li>Students may leave quickly at the end of the day or volunteer to stay behind, hoping to avoid confrontations outside the classroom or school. They may avoid specific areas in the school where bullies are likely to be encountered.</li>
                            <li>Bullied students may look like other students who are under stress (unhappy, tearful, sullen, sad, anxious, avoidant, etc.) and may complain of headaches, nausea, and fatigue because of sleep difficulties.</li>
                            <li>Students may experience difficulty concentrating, a change in level of participation or work productivity, have an unexplained change in attendance patterns, or be easily distracted and slow to progress.</li>
                            <li>Students may report vandalized or stolen personal property, damaged or missing possessions, or lost money.</li>
                            <li>Students might run away, become secretive or school phobic, feel suicidal, or start stealing to pay off the bully.</li>
                            <li>Students who are experiencing anxiety or stress as a result of cyberbullying may show an obsessive interest or, conversely, an avoidance of social media and the Internet.</li>
                            <li>Students who experience weight stigmatization and teasing may be depressed, anxious, exhibit low self-esteem and bodydissatisfaction, have suicidal ideations, and participate in unhealthy eating behaviours and binge eating (Puhl, 2009).</li>

They may feel or pretend to be sick to avoid these situations, and this can interfere with their school attendance.</li>
                            <li>Students who are bullied may also take on BULLYING behaviour as a coping and/or learned behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Students who bully may be the victim of BULLYING by others.</li>
                            <li>Students may avoid or miss classes, run away, or become secretive or school phobic.</li>
                            <li>Student grades may drop.</li>
