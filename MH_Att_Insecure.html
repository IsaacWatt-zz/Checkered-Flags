                        suffering from attachment-related difficulties. Sometimes these children have been victims of
                        long-standing neglect and abuse, without a consistent and nurturing primary caregiver, or have
                        had to endure multiple moves. Understandably, these children may find it very difficult to form

                        often seek out the attention and approval of teachers and peers, only to “ruin” what they have
                        tried to secure.</p>

                                    the

                                <li>Consider the child’s behaviour as his/her attempt to solve a problem that he/she

                                    express
                                    in words. Try to give it words for them—for example, “Maybe you broke your pencil so
                                    you
                                    didn’t
                                    have to finish the work you are worried you can’t do well today”.

                                <li>Consistently reinforce the concept of choice—the idea of people making choices and
                                    having
                                    responsibility is not something these children have experienced. They need to have
                                    it
                                    pointed
                                    out, matter of factly, over and over, that they are making choices all the time.
                                    Then
                                    discussion
                                    can begin to move towards making better vs. worse choices.

                                <li>Ask questions to unmask the child’s hidden agenda. His/her non-verbal reactions may

                                    much
                                    more than the answers to the questions.
