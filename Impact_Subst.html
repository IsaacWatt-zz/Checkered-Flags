                    <p><strong>Substance use (including gambling and gaming):</strong> Substance use is considered problematic when it begins to have a negative impact on a person’s life. Sometimes these problems can be caused by a regular pattern of alcohol or drug misuse. However, even irregular consumption of large amounts of a substance, such as alcohol, can lead to serious consequences for a person.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A 2011 survey of Ontario students in Grades 7 to 12 found that</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>alcohol, high-caffeine energy drinks, and cannabis were the substances used most often by students.</li>
                        <li>22.3% of students in Ontario had engaged in binge drinking (5 or more drinks on one occasion).</li>
                        <li>the number of students engaged in substance use increases with grade level.</li>
                        <li>36.2% of students reported using no substances (including alcohol and tobacco).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gambling: Gambling occurs when someone risks something of value (e.g., money, iPods, jewellery, etc.) on a game, contest, or event where the outcome is uncertain (you do not know if you will win or lose).</p>

                        <p>The best way to determine whether or not teens may be harmfully involved with alcohol, drugs, or gambling is to look at what is happening in different areas of their lives. Changes in what would be considered typical behaviour for teens should be noted. Here are some examples of signs to be aware of:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>changes at school: marks, attendance, attitude towards school, behaviour problems</li>
                            <li>emotional changes: mood swings, increased defiance, anxiety, paranoia</li>
                            <li>social changes: changes in peer group, decreased interest in activities previously enjoyed, sudden increased popularity, loss of friends, secretive about friends/activities</li>
                            <li>legal problems: alcohol or drug charges; theft, assault, or other illegal behaviour while under the influence</li>
                            <li>physical changes: weight loss, tired/run down, atypical amounts of energy, appetite changes, frequent illnesses, increase in accidents, memory problems, less concern about appearance, change in sleeping patterns</li>
                            <li>changes in family relationships: withdrawing from family, no longer following rules at home, isolating self, increased tension at home</li>
                            <li>financial changes: increase in spending money, their own or other’s possessions are missing, money is spent with nothing to show for it, frequent job changes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>It is common for parents and other concerned adults to feel the need to catch a teen using or gambling in order to feel that they have proof. These feeling are often motivated by a natural desire to protect kids and keep them safe. If you have noticed changes in a teen you care about, you should express concern to them. The way in which this concern is communicated will have a lot to do with how it is received.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Peer pressure:</strong> Young people may give in to pressures from other youth to try drugs. They may use a drug to feel part of the crowd or to act grown-up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pleasure:</strong> Some teenagers say they take drugs to feel good.</li>
                            <li><strong>Curiosity or experimentation:</strong> Teenagers may be tempted to try a drug to find out what it is like. Usually people who use a drug for this reason do not continue use for long periods of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Boredom:</strong> If they lack outside activities and interests after school, young people may want to try something new and exciting. The 9:00 to 3:30 routine may be as boring to children as the 9:00 to 5:00 routine is for many adults.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-esteem:</strong> Young people, like adults, often use drugs to try to feel more confident about themselves. Drugs make them feel more important and powerful and less vulnerable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coping with stress:</strong> Many young people have not fully developed their problem-solving skills. Some of them use drugs to help cope with problems at school, in the family, and with social relationships.</li>
                            <li><strong>Escapism:</strong> Drugs can make things seem better than they really are. Problems don’t seem as real or important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rebellion:</strong> Young people may use drugs to rebel against authority figures (e.g., parents/caregivers, teachers).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Drug use may be an indicator of underlying mental health issues.</li>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p><strong>To feel good:</strong> Most drugs and gambling can induce feelings of pleasure. Stimulants, such as caffeine, can make people feel powerful and more confident, and they also increase energy. Depressants, such as alcohol, often leave people feeling relaxed and satisfied. Thinking about winning at gambling can be very exciting, and an actual win can make you feel important, successful, skilled, and very happy.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>To feel better:</strong> Often people use drugs to “take the edge off” and feel comfortable. This often occurs when people are experiencing social anxiety or stress. Substance use can also lesson feelings of distress that often accompany trauma and depression. People may also use gambling to escape depression, anxiety, or stress.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>To do better:</strong> Many people also use substances to help them perform tasks better. They make take a stimulant to stay awake and study or steroids to make them a better athlete.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>For curiosity or social interaction:</strong> Engaging in substance use and gambling can help people to build connections with others. As well, these activities are often exciting, which can be attractive to people who have a particular need for novelty and a higher than usual tolerance for risk.</p>
