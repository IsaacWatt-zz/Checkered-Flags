                    <p>RESILIENCE is the capacity that helps us thrive even when faced with adversity. Resilient
                        students are more likely to weather difficulties, resolve problems, and see their education
                        through to completion.</p><br>
                    <p>RESILIENCE is bolstered by internal factors, such as the way our brains work, and by
                        environmental ones, such as positive social relationships and experiences of well-earned
                        success. RESILIENCE development may be hampered when students lack a sense of belonging and
                        accomplishment, when they have few external supports, and when they are not taught the skills
                        they need to manage impulsiveness or communicate effectively.</p>

                    <p>Low RESILIENCE may be a factor when students:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>seem easily discouraged.</li>
                        <li>have few social ties and supports (both in and out of the school environment).</li>
                        <li>have a hard time building positive relationships with others.</li>
                        <li>lack a sense of belonging.</li>
                        <li>do not perceive themselves as having any areas of strength.</li>
                        <li>are not well supported in mastering their particular challenges (e.g., attention deficit

                    <p>All students will experience hardship at some point during their school careers and in their
                        lives. RESILIENCE helps students overcome these hardships. When vulnerable students experience
                        school life as RESILIENCE-promoting, they are more likely to stay engaged and be able to
                        capitalize on the important benefits of school completion. They feel they belong and can succeed
                        in spite of difficulties and, when obstacles mount, these students are able to overcome
                        them. </p>
