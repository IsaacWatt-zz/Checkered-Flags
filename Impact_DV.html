                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Dating violence is a repeated pattern of actual or threatened acts that emotionally, verbally, physically, or sexually hurt another person. One partner tries to maintain power and control over the other through abuse.  Teenagers often experience violence in dating relationships. This can happen in same-sex relationships as well.  Dating violence crosses all racial, economic, and social lines.  Most victims are young women, who are at greater risk for serious injury. Teenagers can choose better relationships when they learn to identify the early warning signs of an abusive relationship, understand that they have choices, and believe that they are valuable people who deserve to be treated with respect.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>Teen dating violence is often hidden because teens are typically inexperienced with dating relationships; are pressured by peers to act violently; want independence from parents/caregivers; and have romantic views of love. Teen dating violence is influenced by how teens look at themselves and others.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The following are examples of some of the different forms that dating violence can take:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical abuse: hitting, blocking, pushing, pinching, biting, choking, and threatening with a weapon</li>
                            <li>Emotional abuse: insulting, pressuring, blaming, smashing things, possessiveness, stalking, isolating, cheating to make someone feel insecure, insulting someone’s identity (e.g., culture, race, gender, income level, sexual orientation, physical/mental abilities), following, continual emailing, calling, or texting</li>
                            <li>Sexual abuse: unwanted sexual contact, forcing a date to do sexual things, pushing or tricking someone into sex, forced kissing or touching, refusal to use a condom or other method for safer sex</li>
                             <li>Financial abuse: controlling money, making someone depend on you for money</li>
                            <li>Spiritual abuse: insulting someone’s beliefs, stopping someone from following their faith or religion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                            <li>they have the right to control their female partners in any way they want</li>

                            <li>they should demand intimacy</li>
                            <li>they may lose respect if they are attentive to and supportive of their girlfriends</li>
                            <li>it is impossible for them to be the victims of abuse at the hands of their girlfriends (role reversal).</li>

                            <li>their boyfriend’s jealousy, possessiveness, and even physical abuse is “romantic”</li>

Putting victim safety first means considering the possible impact of any course of action on the victim.  It is important to ask the question:  will he/she be endangered by anyone as a result of these actions?  Safety planning with the victim and his/her support providers is a necessary part of reporting or notifying others on behalf of the victim.</li>
