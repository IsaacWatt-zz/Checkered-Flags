                        <li>contamination worries, expressing themselves in behaviours such as excessive handwashing or fear of touching certain things (e.g., door handles, shoes)</li>
                        <li>preoccupation with having things in a certain order, or doing things in a certain way or a certain number of times</li>
                        <li>fear of doing wrong or having done wrong, which may lead to asking others for reassurance over and over again</li>
                        <li>excessive checking of such things as doors, lights, locks, windows, and homework</li>
                        <li>perfectionism of an intense and exacting sort that makes it nearly impossible for children to complete anything because of their own impossible standards</li>
                        <li>excessive hoarding or collecting of things (which may or may not be valuable), to the point where it can cause a safety or fire hazard.</li>

                                <li>Children struggling with OCD already know that their behaviour does not make sense—avoid efforts to cajole or argue children out of these behaviours.</li>
                                <li>Be patient. The child dealing with OCD is struggling against something that is as real an impediment to school success and social functioning as a broken leg would be to sports success. Both need time and treatment in order to be overcome.</li>
                                <li>As a parent, make sure that praise focuses only on a child’s accomplishments. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Good:     “Awesome! You managed to sit through lunch break without needing to get up and wash your hands.”</li>
                                    <li>Bad:     “Awesome! You managed to sit through lunch break without needing to get up and wash your hands. If only you could do that every day…”</li>
                                </ul></li>
                                <li>Make sure to offer praise free from any criticism.</li>
                                <li>As with other forms of anxiety, family doctors or specialists can make decisions about whether medication can play a helpful role, and children’s mental health services can be essential in providing treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy for the child, psycho-education for families, and consultation with school teams to help plan for student success.</li>

                        <p>Oliver used to be a happy child, active with sports and friends, and he enjoyed doing well in school. Recently he has lost interest in doing things he used to enjoy. He has always been a clean freak, but since watching a television show about virus outbreaks, he has become obsessed with getting sick. He is spending more and more time washing. Although he has always been a bit of a perfectionist, lately he will stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, trying to get his homework just perfect, and he will be exhausted the next day.</p>
