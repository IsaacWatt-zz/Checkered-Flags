                    <p>Self-esteem is the value you place on yourself. It is the image you have of yourself, measured
                        against what you think you should be (with regard to your talents, skills, intellect, social
                        skills, physical abilities, and appearance). It is normal for self-esteem to fluctuate
                        throughout life, with adolescence being one of the most fragile times. Thoughts and actions can
                        reinforce or undermine self-esteem. By taking the focus away from appearance, students may
                        achieve a more rounded self-concept where appearance is only one of many attributes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Body image is a part of self-esteem and is a person’s perception of his or her body size, shape,
                        and attractiveness. Body image also includes a person’s attitudes and feelings about his or her
                        body and how they think others see them. A healthy body image means knowing how to take care of
                        yourself and feeling good in your body. Instead of striving for a “perfect body,” you find other
                        ways to feel good about yourself. Positive body image is linked to good self-esteem, and these
                        two qualities build a student’s confidence and resilience.</p>
