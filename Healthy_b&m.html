                                    variety of challenging movements and can build literacy at their own pace).

                                    Daily Physical Activity/DPA). Modify physical activities to be non-competitive and
                                    inclusive of all skill levels.

                                    grow.
                                </li>
                                <li>Make mealtimes pleasant (e.g., eat meals together and talk about positive things).

                                <li>Encourage children to eat when hungry and stop when they are full.</li>
                                <li>Let your child decide how much food to eat from the healthy choices you offer.</li>

                                <li>Use meal and snack times to teach your children about different foods, food
                                    preparation,
                                    and good table manners.

                                <li>Offer new foods more than once without pressure—it may take 10 or 15 tries before
                                    they
                                    will actually eat them!

                                <li>Teach that all foods, including treats, can be part of healthy eating. Avoid
                                    labelling
                                    foods as good or bad; instead use the terms “everyday” and “sometimes” foods.

                                <li>Avoid allowing your children and teens to drink energy drinks. One energy drink
                                    could
                                    have more caffeine in it than the recommended daily intake.
