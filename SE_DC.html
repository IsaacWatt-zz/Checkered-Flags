                    <p>Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities vary in their ability to communicate,
                        do school work and socialize. The disabilities refer to a range of cognitive, social/emotional,
                        adaptive and motor delays. Students with mild intellectual disabilities can develop basic
                        literacy skills and functional mathematics skills. A child will sometimes be identified before
                        they enter school. Use the assessment findings to provide supports and ACCOMMODATIONS that are
                        tailored to suit the student’s current needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Intellectual and developmental disabilities are identified through psychological or
                        psycho-educational assessment. These assessments use standardized testing tools to identify
                        strengths and weaknesses. Assessment also includes the use of other tools to determine skills in
                        adaptive behaviour, which includes skills in the following areas: communication, self-direction,
                        functional academic skills work and leisure, health and safety.</p>

                                <li>Remember that background noises such as television, radio, conversations, etc., can
                                    increase difficulty in communication.
                                </li>
                                <li>Assume a face-to-face position (expressions provide information too) and keep good
                                    eye contact with the child.
                                </li>
                                <li>Deal with one issue at a time. Keep to the topic and note other “issues for further
                                    discussion at a later time. Make a clear break between topics. If possible, do not
                                    attempt more than one (or at most two) topics in one session.
                                </li>
                                <li>Do not attempt anything more than the bare minimum of communication if the child is
                                    tired, ill, or distracted.
                                </li>
                                <li>Do not interrupt, or permit interruption, unless absolutely necessary. Conversations
                                    wander badly with interruptions. Try to have some visual cues for the topic— a
                                    calendar to talk about appointments, illustrations or simple diagrams to provide
                                    information, making written lists, or even “stick figure” drawings can enhance both
                                    receptive and expressive language.
                                </li>
                                <li>Use gestures and encourage the child to use gestures to help get a point across.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Speak slowly—not loudly, just slowly. Remember that speech sounds at least twice as
                                    fast to a person listening as it does to the person speaking.
                                </li>
                                <li>Speak in short phrases and pause briefly between each phrase. Remember that a child
                                    needs a little more time to take in what is being said.
                                </li>
                                <li>If the child is able, ask for a paraphrase of what has been said. Remember that
                                    verbal repetition does not always signify understanding.
                                </li>
                                <li>Try to make a brief summary statement at the end of the message.</li>
                                <li>A discussion is often opened with “Tell me about …”. When children have language
                                    problems, this open-ended approach can be very confusing, even intimidating, and the
                                    result is little or no information. More specific questions are usually much more
                                    effective in these situations. They are also often necessary to help the child “fill
                                    in the gaps” in the story.
                                </li>
                                <li>Keep vocabulary straightforward and direct. It is very easy to slip into jargon, and
                                    the child may not only fail to understand but may also not want to admit that he/she
                                    has not understood.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>When you are listening</p>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Look like an interested listener. Children who have language problems usually rely
                                    quite heavily on non-verbal cues. Facial expression may give more feedback than
                                    verbal information.
                                </li>
                                <li>Watch for visual cues such as facial expression, visual focus, gestures, etc., from
                                    the child.
                                </li>
                                <li>Before responding, repeat or paraphrase what the child has said to confirm
                                    understanding of what he/she had in mind. If the information is not understood, ask
                                    for clarification in a manner that does not assign blame. “I’m sorry, I didn’t
                                    understand” can open the door to much better communication.
                                </li>
                                <li>If the child is obviously searching for a word, help out. Offering a multiple
                                    choice, asking for a gestural demonstration, etc., will help keep him/her on topic.
                                </li>
                                <li>Remember that it is the child who has the difficulties, so the responsibility lies
                                    with others to understand and make themselves clear. Others must accommodate because
                                    he/she cannot.
                                </li>
