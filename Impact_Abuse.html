                    <h4>Abuse - Neglect</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Even at the best of times, parenting can be a challenge. When families face serious issues such
                        as poverty, unemployment, inadequate housing, poor health, or relationship breakdowns, it is
                        that much more difficult. Stress on families can lead to poor parenting behaviours. The best way
                        to deal with child abuse and neglect is to prevent it in the first place. That is why it is so
                        important for people to contact their local Children’s Aid Society (CAS) before their family
                        problems get out of control. CAS can work with other professionals to support and help
                        strengthen families through the rough times.</p>
                    <p>Children are in need of protection when they are intentionally harmed (abuse) or when a
                        parent/caregiver fails to protect or provide the necessities of life for children in their care
                        (neglect). Indicators of various forms of abuse are described here simply as a guide to assist
                        in determining when to report a situation to the CAS.</p>
                    <p>The signs or indicators following the descriptions of each type of child maltreatment are common
                        examples of what might be seen in children. It is important to note that the presence or absence
                        of one or more of these indicators is not conclusive proof that a child has been abused or
                        neglected; many of these signs and indicators are seen when children are under significant
                        stress from other life events (e.g., being bullied, the death of a family member, separation
                        from a loved one). Rather, clusters of these indicators must be assessed, together with an
                        overall understanding of the life circumstances of the child, before a conclusion can be made
                        about reporting to child protection staff.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the form of abuse that is inflicted, the emotional impact on children can lead to
                        significant challenges for them throughout their lives.</p>

                                    <p>Physical abuse is any deliberate force or action (usually by a parent or
                                        caregiver) that results, or could result, in physical harm or injury to a child.
                                        It can include punching, slapping, beating, shaking, burning, biting, or
                                        throwing a child. Physical abuse can place a child in need of protection under
                                        the CFSA (Child and Family Services Act). Criminal Code of Canada charges
                                        related to physical abuse include assault, assault causing bodily harm, assault
                                        with a weapon, and aggravated assault.</p>

                                    <p>Sexual abuse is any sexual exploitation of a child by an older person. Coercion
                                        (physical, psychological, or emotional) is intrinsic to sexual abuse. The sexual
                                        abuse of children can take many forms. Examples include sexual intercourse,
                                        fondling, sexual molestation, and sexual interference, and allowing a child to
                                        view or perform in pornographic pictures or videos or engage in prostitution.
                                        The Criminal Code of Canada identifies a number of types of sexual abuse that
                                        are grounds for determining that a child is in need of protection as defined in
                                        the CFSA [s. 37(2)].</p>

                                    <p>Neglect is the failure to meet a child’s basic needs for food, clothing, shelter,
                                        sleep, medical attention, education, adequate adult supervision, and protection
                                        from harm. Most parents do not intend to neglect their children. It usually
                                        results from a lack of knowledge about appropriate care for children or an
                                        inability to organize and plan ahead. Professionals must be careful not to
                                        underestimate the difficulty and stress that living in poverty, inadequate
                                        housing, or ill health can pose for parents trying to raise children under these
                                        circumstances.</p>

                        <li>Traumatized children are more likely to struggle in school, be absent from school, and
                            engage in behaviours that lead to suspensions. The effect of multiple difficulties on
                            children is not simply additive. There is, in fact, a multiplying effect, i.e., each
                            additional problem cascades to create a substantial cumulative impact. However, this
                            phenomenon also works in reverse to multiply the effects of positive interventions. For
                            example, if a youth has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has been abused, is
                            substance abusing, and is usually unsuccessful at school, any initiative that gets that
                            youth to attend school and participate can turn school failure into school success, and the
                            positive effect on other areas of the student’s life can be significant.
                        </li>
                        <li>The child’s life outside of school may be disorganized and inadequately supervised, making
                            it difficult for the child to arrive on time, bring a lunch, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>For some children, school may be the most consistent, safe, and structured setting in their
                            lives. Any initiative that increases the likelihood of abused children being suspended or
                            expelled decreases the chance of a positive outcome for them at school, later in life, and
                            perhaps eventually as parents themselves.
                        </li>
                        <li>Teachers can and often do play a significant role in assisting children to feel a sense of
                            success at school, thereby mitigating some of the damage caused by abuse and neglect in
                            other areas of their lives.
