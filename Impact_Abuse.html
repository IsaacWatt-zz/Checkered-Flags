                    <p>Even at the best of times, parenting can be a challenge.  When families face serious issues such as poverty, unemployment, inadequate housing, poor health, or relationship breakdowns, it is that much more difficult.  Stress on families can lead to poor parenting behaviours.  The best way to deal with child abuse and neglect is to prevent it in the first place.  That is why it is so important for people to contact their local Children’s Aid Society (CAS) before their family problems get out of control.   CAS can work with other professionals to support and help strengthen families through the rough times.</p>
                    <p>Children are in need of protection when they are intentionally harmed (abuse) or when a parent/caregiver fails to protect or provide the necessities of life for children in their care (neglect).  Indicators of various forms of abuse are described here simply as a guide to assist in determining when to report a situation to the CAS.</p>
                    <p>The signs or indicators following the descriptions of each type of child maltreatment are common examples of what might be seen in children.  It is important to note that the presence or absence of one or more of these indicators is not conclusive proof that a child has been abused or neglected; many of these signs and indicators are seen when children are under significant stress from other life events (e.g., being bullied, the death of a family member, separation from a loved one). Rather, clusters of these indicators must be assessed, together with an overall understanding of the life circumstances of the child, before a conclusion can be made about reporting to child protection staff.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the form of abuse that is inflicted, the emotional impact on children can lead to significant challenges for them throughout their lives.</p>

                            <p>Physical abuse is any deliberate force or action (usually by a parent or caregiver) that results, or could result, in physical harm or injury to a child.

                            <p>Sexual abuse is any sexual exploitation of a child by an older person. Coercion (physical, psychological, or emotional) is intrinsic to sexual abuse. The sexual abuse of children can take many forms.  Examples include sexual intercourse, fondling, sexual molestation, and sexual interference, and allowing a child to view or perform in pornographic pictures or videos or engage in prostitution.  The Criminal Code of Canada identifies a number of types of sexual abuse that are grounds for determining that a child is in need of protection as defined in the CFSA [s. 37(2)].</p>

                            <p>Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviour that attacks a child’s emotional development and sense of self-worth.  It includes excessive, aggressive, or unreasonable demands and expectations beyond a child’s capacity.  Emotionally abusive behaviour may include constant criticism or yelling, rejecting or demeaning remarks, ignoring, isolating, or terrorizing the child.  This kind of abuse also includes the chronic failure to provide a child with a sense of love, and emotional support, guidance, and a sense of belonging.</p>

                            <li>Traumatized children are more likely to struggle in school, be absent from school, and engage in behaviours that lead to suspensions.  The effect of multiple difficulties on children is not simply additive. There is, in fact, a multiplying effect, i.e., each additional problem cascades to create a substantial cumulative impact. However, this phenomenon also works in reverse to multiply the effects of positive interventions. For example, if a youth has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has been abused, is substance abusing, and is usually unsuccessful at school, any initiative that gets that youth to attend school and participate can turn school failure into school success, and the positive effect on other areas of the student’s life can be significant.</li>
                            <li>The child’s life outside of school may be disorganized and inadequately supervised, making it difficult for the child to arrive on time, bring a lunch, etc.</li>
                            <li>For some children, school may be the most consistent, safe, and structured setting in their lives.  Any initiative that increases the likelihood of abused children being suspended or expelled decreases the chance of a positive outcome for them at school, later in life, and perhaps eventually as parents themselves.</li>
                            <li>Teachers can and often do play a significant role in assisting children to feel a sense of success at school, thereby mitigating some of the damage caused by abuse and neglect in other areas of their lives.</li>
