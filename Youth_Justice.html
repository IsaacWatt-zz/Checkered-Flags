                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA), a young person is defined as a youth between the
                        ages of 12 and 17. If an offence is committed after a youth reaches the age of 18, the young
                        person is charged as an adult.</p>
                    <p>The key principles of the YCJA and the Youth Justice System are to</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending
                            behaviour
                        </li>
                        <li>rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society</li>
                        <li>ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offence.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The YCJA says that measures taken against young persons who commit offences should</p>
                    <em>be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development
                        and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or
                        other agencies in the young person’s rehabilitation and reintegration.</em>

                    <p>Prior to laying a criminal charge, police must first consider whether it would be sufficient,

                    <ul>

                        victim, and trained members of the community. Together, they negotiate an appropriate way for
                        the young person to make amends for his or her actions.</p>

                        perspective of the victim. Some examples of offences that might trigger a request for school

                    <p>Teachers and other educational professionals have daily, direct contact with children and youth
                        and can play an essential role in their social development. Schools often represent the only
                        social venue in a community where a child or youth at risk can be identified and measures taken
                        to help him or her at an early stage. Schools are sometimes the target of aggressive behaviour
                        by troubled youth. Schools can be called upon to play a key role with youth involved in the
                        justice system because school attendance is often included as part of a probation order or other
                        sentence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>School officials can play a major role in the success of youth justice initiatives by helping to
                        prevent youth crime through supervision, by defining how best to handle behavioural problems in
                        the school setting, by working with youth involved in the justice system to ensure that their
                        educational and other needs are addressed, and by supporting the reintegration of youth into the
                        community.</p>

                    <strong>Working with Community Justice Partners</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>Many individuals in the volunteer and social services sectors have regular, direct contact with
                        children and youth and can play a strong role in contributing to their well-being and in
                        supporting their social development. Offering a broad range of services in the community, many
                        agencies are particularly involved in helping the most socially disadvantaged. Members of these
                        organizations generally have a good understanding of their community and the special issues that
                        affect young people. As such, they are a good source of support to the school community to
                        assist young people with ongoing needs as they attempt to deal with the factors that brought
                        them into conflict with the law.</p>
