                        <li>prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour</li>
                        <li>rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society</li>
                        <li>ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The YCJA says that measures taken against young persons who commit offences should</p>
                    <em>be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person’s rehabilitation and reintegration.</em>

                        <p>If the offence takes place on school property or is related to the school in some way, school personnel may be invited to participate in a Youth Justice Committee forum to share the perspective of the victim.

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>Teachers and other educational professionals have daily, direct contact with children and youth and can play an essential role in their social development.  Schools often represent the only social venue in a community where a child or youth at risk can be identified and measures taken to help him or her at an early stage.  Schools are sometimes the target of aggressive behaviour by troubled youth.  Schools can be called upon to play a key role with youth involved in the justice system because school attendance is often included as part of a probation order or other sentence.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>School officials can play a major role in the success of youth justice initiatives by helping to prevent youth crime through supervision, by defining how best to handle behavioural problems in the school setting, by working with youth involved in the justice system to ensure that their educational and other needs are addressed, and by supporting the reintegration of youth into the community.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Working with Community Justice Partners</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>Many individuals in the volunteer and social services sectors have regular, direct contact with children and youth and can play a strong role in contributing to their well-being and in supporting their social development.  Offering a broad range of services in the community, many agencies are particularly involved in helping the most socially disadvantaged.  Members of these organizations generally have a good understanding of their community and the special issues that affect young people.  As such, they are a good source of support to the school community to assist young people with ongoing needs as they attempt to deal with the factors that brought them into conflict with the law.</p>
