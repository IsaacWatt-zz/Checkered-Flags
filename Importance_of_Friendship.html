                        worse in school and to later drop out. Because students often study with their friends, help
                        each other with homework, and even informally tutor one another, a student who lacks friends is
                        likely to miss out on opportunities to learn school material. Furthermore, a child who is having
                        problems getting along with others may be more upset and distracted and therefore, find it
                        harder to concentrate. Even if a child’s academic work is respectable, a child with serious peer
                        relationship problems might drop out because school is not an enjoyable place. Indeed, being at
                        school may be quite stressful.” (Reprinted with permission from the National Network for Child
                        Care – NNCC. Asher, S.R. & Williams, G. (1993). Children without friends, Part 1: Their
                        problems. In Todd, C.M. (ED.), *Day care center connections*, 2(6), pp. 3-4. Urbana-Champaign,

                    <p>“The academic benefits of having friends show up very early in a child’s school career. Consider,
                        for example, research by Ladd (1990) on children who are making the transition from preschool
                        programs to kindergarten. This research suggests that those who start kindergarten with a friend
                        in their class make a better adjustment to school than those who do not start with a friend.
                        Furthermore, children who maintain their friendships as the school year progresses like school
                        better, and children who make new friends make greater gains in school performance.” (Reprinted
