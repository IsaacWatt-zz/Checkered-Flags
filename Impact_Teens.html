                    <p>Teenage pregnancy has long been conceptualized as a social problem requiring preventive efforts
                        (e.g., Maynard, 1997). While preventing teen pregnancy has obvious benefits, it is certainly not
                        always possible. Despite a recent decline in teenage pregnancies in Canada, there are still an
                        estimated 40,000 teenage girls who become pregnant each year, resulting in an estimated 20,000
                        births (Statistics Canada, 2006). Being pregnant during adolescence poses a number of
                        challenges. Compared to their non-pregnant peers, pregnant teens have low levels of education,
                        as well as low expectations for education and the job market (www.genderandhealth.ca; Singh,
                        Darroch, & Frost, 2001). Pregnant teens also tend to have lower incomes (Al-Sahab et al., 2012).
                        Research shows that youth living in poverty have a teen pregnancy rate five times the average
                        (Stonehocker, 1997). Thus, socio-economic circumstances seem to play a major role in the rates
                        of teen pregnancy. Due to these challenges, it is often difficult for young parents to remain in
                        school and achieve success and security. As a result, it is vitally important to understand how
                        you can support them during this challenging and life-changing time.</p>

                    <p>Becoming pregnant as an adolescent can have a major impact on student success—both during
                        pregnancy and after the baby is born.</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pregnancy is the greatest single cause of female students dropping out of school. In
                            addition, teenage fathers are also significantly less likely to complete high school than
                            their non-parent peers. (http://www.lausd.net/lausd/offices/eec/parenting.htm)
                        </li>
                        <li>Pregnant teens are more likely to drop out of school due to feelings of stigmatization, lack
                            of support from family members, school staff, and peers, physical and emotional strain, and
                            the inability to keep up with or attend classes because of the need to stay home and care
                            for the baby once he/she is born.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dropping out of school greatly limits career opportunities for teenage parents and, as a
                            result, many of these individuals and their children live in poverty (e.g., East, Reyes, &
                            Horn, 2007).
                        </li>
                        <li>Living in poverty also makes it difficult for teen parents to access childcare services,
                            increasing the chances that these individuals will not be able to return to school.

                                <li>Remember that teenage pregnancy is not always seen as a negative situation; some

                                    are more accepting of it and/or view pregnancy as a natural and positive event for

                                    they need in school. This encourages pregnant teens to go to a teacher with their

                                <li>Be a good listener—teen mothers/fathers need someone to talk to. One of the most

                                    reducing their chances of achieving success and security in the future. Encourage
