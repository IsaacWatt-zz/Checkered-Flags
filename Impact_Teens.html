                    <p>Teenage pregnancy has long been conceptualized as a social problem requiring preventive efforts (e.g., Maynard, 1997). While preventing teen pregnancy has obvious benefits, it is certainly not always possible. Despite a recent decline in teenage pregnancies in Canada, there are still an estimated 40,000 teenage girls who become pregnant each year, resulting in an estimated 20,000 births (Statistics Canada, 2006). Being pregnant during adolescence poses a number of challenges. Compared to their non-pregnant peers, pregnant teens have low levels of education, as well as low expectations for education and the job market (www.genderandhealth.ca; Singh, Darroch, & Frost, 2001). Pregnant teens also tend to have lower incomes (Al-Sahab et al., 2012). Research shows that youth living in poverty have a teen pregnancy rate five times the average (Stonehocker, 1997). Thus, socio-economic circumstances seem to play a major role in the rates of teen pregnancy. Due to these challenges, it is often difficult for young parents to remain in school and achieve success and security. As a result, it is vitally important to understand how you can support them during this challenging and life-changing time.</p>

                        <p>Becoming pregnant as an adolescent can have a major impact on student success—both during pregnancy and after the baby is born.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pregnancy is the greatest single cause of female students dropping out of school. In addition, teenage fathers are also significantly less likely to complete high school than their non-parent peers. (http://www.lausd.net/lausd/offices/eec/parenting.htm)</li>
                            <li>Pregnant teens are more likely to drop out of school due to feelings of stigmatization, lack of support from family members, school staff, and peers, physical and emotional strain, and the inability to keep up with or attend classes because of the need to stay home and care for the baby once he/she is born.</li>
                            <li>Dropping out of school greatly limits career opportunities for teenage parents and, as a result, many of these individuals and their children live in poverty (e.g., East, Reyes, & Horn, 2007).</li>
                            <li>Living in poverty also makes it difficult for teen parents to access childcare services, increasing the chances that these individuals will not be able to return to school.</li>

                                <li>Many pregnant teens suffer from low self-esteem. You can help to reinforce a sense of self-worth in pregnant teens and new parents by telling them how great they are doing.</li>
                                <li>Be a good listener—teen mothers/fathers need someone to talk to. One of the most important things you can do is listen to their concerns and/or fears without judgment.</li>
