                    <p>The act of deliberately harming one’s own body by means such as cutting or burning is referred to
                        as self-injurious behaviour (SIB) and is used as a way of coping. Self-injurious behaviour is an
                        attempt by a child to</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>escape from feelings of numbness (some say that they injure themselves to feel something or
                            to know that they are alive)
                        </li>
                        <li>draw needed attention, support, or signs of caring from others</li>
                        <li>feel in control (e.g., control over one’s body, control over others)</li>
                        <li>turn intense, unmanageable emotional pain into physical pain</li>
                        <li>escape from feelings of emptiness and depression</li>
                        <li>relieve tension</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>For children who believe their distress is invisible, self-harm is a way of creating physical
                        proof of their emotional pain and of maintaining hope that it will be noticed and addressed. For
                        others, the physical pain from self-harm can be a way to distract themselves from the emotional
                        pain they feel. Many of these children may not have learned healthy ways of identifying and
                        expressing overwhelming negative emotions, such as intense anger, tension, or frustration; they
                        find temporary relief from these distressing feelings through harming themselves.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Other mental health difficulties often occur alongside SIB, and a successful approach to freeing
                        a student from it needs to address these difficulties as well, improve coping skills and
                        practices, and resolve the underlying distress.</p>
