                    <p>When children experience something—either real or perceived—that threatens their lives or sense
                        of safety, it can overwhelm their capacity to regulate their emotions. Generally, traumatic
                        events evoke feelings of extreme fear and helplessness—children no longer trust what they once
                        believed to be certain about their world. A child may be affected by trauma because of events
                        such as a sudden loss or injury or an unremitting circumstance such as chronic neglect or a long
                        illness.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some traumatic experiences occur once in a lifetime, others are ongoing. Some children experience
                        multiple traumas, and for too many children, trauma is a chronic part of their lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some children show signs of stress in the first few weeks after a trauma but then return to their
                        usual state of physical and emotional health. For others, recovery can be much more difficult
                        and prolonged.</p>

                    <p>The symptoms of trauma in a child can range from evident, external distress to withdrawal and
                        becoming more internally closed off. Often the best indicator is whether a student has changed
                        over time. Does his/her trajectory seem developmentally predictable? Or does it seem unexpected,
                        given what is known about the child? Other indicators may include</p>

                        <li>a change in the child’s normal activity level or engagement</li>
                        <li>concentration problems</li>
                        <li>avoidance behaviours (e.g., resisting going to places that remind him/her of the event)</li>
                        <li>hyper-arousal (e.g., being easily startled)</li>
                        <li>recreating/reliving the event (e.g., repeatedly talking about, “playing out”, or drawing the

                        <li>Their internal resources are so caught up in managing the effects of trauma that they have

                        </li>
                        <li>Many behaviours seen in students who have experienced trauma are nearly identical to those
                            of students with developmental delays, AD/HD, and other mental health concerns. When efforts
                            and energy are directed to addressing these apparent symptoms and not the trauma itself, the
                            student and the support team can feel discouraged when outcomes do not improve.

                                    of the trauma (e.g., some students will try to provoke teachers and other adults in
